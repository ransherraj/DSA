## ðŸŒ± Introduction

A **binary tree** is a fundamental data structure where each node has at most two children. It forms the basis of many advanced structures and algorithms.

ðŸ“ˆ Mastery of binary trees improves your problem-solving, recursion skills, and understanding of **DFS**, **BFS**, **Heaps**, and **Tries**.
